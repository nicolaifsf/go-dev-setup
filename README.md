# go-dev-setup
Opinionated code directory structure trigger

NOTE: Currently start.sh works with only zsh

I personally like to be able to create my projects in any directory I would like. Golang however is highly opinionated in terms of the directory structure. This adds the command 'gg' to spawn a golang development environment in the current project directory such that one can work from anywhere. Depends on docker.
